<!-- eds...think through the cracks...the cracks in the floor earth (object with potential for cracks)...the cracks on the sidewalk street running behind you, crisscrossing, crosscrissing, turning, spinning, ending...we don’t follow the cracks.  at least, i  think i don’t... i think... don’t...i do...i...think...i not...not think...do...not...i do not...do not what?  i think i do not think, but then again, here I am thinking... so i think i think i don’t think, but it seems rather clear that thinking i do not think is thinking itself...therefore, i think (but am i? that is, ergo sum?)... and if i think, then what?  the terrors that await...the terrors of thinking or the terrors within thinking await?  perhaps both, but i should be afraid just to be safe...but if i’m afraid, then i’m not safe...how could one be afraid and be safe at the same time, unless the fear was for a future point in time or their fear was unfounded?  perhaps that doesn’t matter...founded fear i mean...and future...the future doesn’t matter...it doesn’t matter one bit and anyone who tells you doesn’t really know...and if they don’t know, they don’t think (or think hard enough)... here we go again with the thinking...thnikngi...hitnikgn...think...dreaming...dreaming things that reflect our present situation, which is really what this is all about... by this i mean, this, everything, this... what is this anyway?  what is everything? veryethngi...evryehgint...how can i even say everything is this when i do not know everything?  i cannot know everything... nor would i want to... that would be the single most terrifying experience of my existence.  besides, what fun how interesting would that be if i knew why would i want to know everything?  everything...everything...everything... all things...the totality of things...the sum total of things...i shudder at the thought...i stutter at the thought...shudder...stutter...smutter thought...i...if i stutter smutter at the thought, then i am thinking...unless it is someone else’s thought...how can one have another’s thought in them, without it then becoming their own thought?  how accurate an image of another’s thought can we have at all?  if it is only accurate to a certain extent, then is it the same thought?  when is the same thought no longer the same thought?  can we even have the same thoughts ourselves?  after all, any thought we have changes us...changes our experience...therefore, the same thought no longer constitutes the same experience...since we have changed since we had that thought...therefore...tehrefroe...even if we grant that we can have another’s pure, unadulterated thought in us, it would still be the case that we are thinking...even through another’s thought...wait i think i’ve lost you...me...us...them...i think i’ve lost myself...no i’ve got myself (i think thought) but it doesn’t matter...neither does the future...nor the past...and if the future and past do not matter, what of the present?  i hate presents, come to think of it...gifts are okay, but presents...something about the presents...in reality, the past and future are composed of presents (i hate presents) past or to come...if these presents (i hate presents) don’t matter, then what must we conclude about our current present?  the one that’s now...the one that’s just past as you’ve read these words...the one that’s passing as you read these words...you’ll never get it back...it’s gone forever...but it doesn’t matter...we could spend our lives reading and writing the same words...and everything will turn out the same as if we didn’t...as if we were mother-goddamn-theresa... actually, that’s inaccurate... mother theresa isn’t goddamned...that is not to say that there is a god, but either way, she would not be goddamned...anyway, i think its time i apologized... -->

Although trained as a composer, Jacob Sundstrom’s work has branched out into several mediums and field including new media, installation, and data-driven art. He is interested in exploiting idiosyncratic properties of mediums as a way to expose hidden and latent layers of meaning. His work focuses on the friction between and among medium, performer(s), and process: using the process against the performers, the process against the medium, the medium against the performers, and visa versa and so on. Out of this friction arises fascinating, beautiful, and often surprising results.

Sundstrom’s musical work has been performed by ensembles including Inverted Space, the JACK Quartet, and the Seattle Chamber Players. It has been performed or played in places as diverse as Radiophrenia in Scotland, art galleries and underground venues in Seattle, and the National Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C). His visual work has been showcased by the Center on Contemporary Art (Seattle, WA) and he was a featured artist at the Georgetown Art Attack Special Events at CoCA Un[contained] at Equinox Studios. His work has also been shown at the Behind the Static glitch art show at Erickson Clock (Atlanta, GA), the Daegu Art Factory (Daegu, South Korea), Piksel17 (Bergen, Norway), San Diego Art Institute (San Diego, CA), and at Common AREA Maintenance (Seattle, WA). As a visual artist, Sundstrom was profiled in the June 2016 issue of the Not Random Art Contemporary Art Review magazine.

As a researcher, he has helped develop brain-computer musical interfaces for use in performance settings. His work on EEG-driven musical interfaces has been published in _Frontiers in Human Neuroscience_ and presented at the Society for Neuroscience’s annual meeting. For what it’s worth, he studied music and philosophy at the University of California, San Diego and music at the University of Washington. He is currently a PhD candidate in computer music at the University of California, San Diego and holds a studio at [Space4Art](http://www.sdspace4art.org/). Outside of his creative pursuits, Jacob enjoys studying economics/finance, going to bullfights on acid, and Type II fun.
