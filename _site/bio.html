<p>Although trained as a composer, Jacob Sundstrom’s work has branched out into several mediums and fields. Among these interests are installation, visual, glitch, data bending, and EEG-driven art. His work tends to focus on the friction between and among medium, performer(s), and process: using the process against the performers, the process against the medium, the medium against the performers, and visa versa and so on. Out of this friction arises fascinating, beautiful, and often surprising results.</p>

<p>Sundstrom’s musical work has been performed by ensembles including Inverted Space, the JACK Quartet, and the Seattle Chamber Players. It has been performed or played in places as diverse as Radiophrenia in Scotland, art galleries and underground venues in Seattle, and the National Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C). His visual work has been showcased by the Center on Contemporary Art in Seattle and he was a featured artist at the Georgetown Art Attack Special Events at CoCA Un[contained] at Equinox Studios. His work has also been shown at the Behind the Static glitch art show at Erickson Clock (Atlanta, GA), the Daegu Art Factory (Daegu, South Korea), Piksel17 (Bergen, Norway) and at Common AREA Maintenance (Seattle, WA). As a visual artist, Sundstrom was profiled in the June 1016 issue of the Not Random Art Contemporary Art Review magazine.</p>

<p>As a researcher, he has helped develop brain-computer musical interfaces for use in performance settings. His work on EEG-driven musical interfaces has been published in <em>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience</em> and presented at the Society for Neuroscience’s annual meeting. For what it’s worth, he studied music and philosophy at the University of California, San Diego and music at the University of Washington. He is currently a PhD student in computer music at the University of California, San Diego and enjoys going to bullfights on acid and Type II fun.</p>
