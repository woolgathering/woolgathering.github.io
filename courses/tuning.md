.....................................................................<br/>
__Note:__ Although we are slated for three-hour sessions twice weekly, I do not expect any of us (myself included) to remain sentient enough to overcome any diminishing returns after about 90-100 minutes of "Zoom time". Therefore, unless there are a majority of objections, we will have approximately 90-minute classes with listening and response assignments for every day we would meet. We can discuss this further on the first day of class.<br/>
.....................................................................

While we in the West have become accustomed to 12-tone equal temperament, the issue of musical tuning has a complex history with many avenues explored, settled upon and abandoned. This course will present an overview of various tuning and temperament systems that have been and are used in Western music. Included are equal temperament, just intonation, meantone temperament, well temperament, and exotic flavors of scales, some purely theoretical. There will be a significant listening portion to the course, focused primarily on musical examples. A list is given below.

To maximize your chances of success in this course you should understand basic musical concepts and be able to read music at a very basic level (the latter is not necessary but will help in some contexts). In addition, you should be comfortable with basic math, ratios, and multiplying fractions.

_DISCLAIMER_: This course may be detrimental to composers who may become so enthralled at new possibilities that they eventually find themselves in remote regions of musical thought, alone, with neither sustenance nor shelter.

## Materials and Tools
There are no required textbooks for this course although there is a significant list of required listening, a shorter list of required reading (often from Barbour), and a further list of recommended perusing below. Keep in mind that this list is not necessarily complete; any and all updates will be posted to the course website. A simple program will also be made available such that scales can be created, heard, and etudes can be written.

### Tuning Programs
Sean Archibald made an [excellent browser-based tuning program](https://sevish.com/scaleworkshop/) that allows one to load, save, and create scales. Since my web development skills are virtually non-existent, we'll be using his creation. Most of the scales, however common, will be created by hand in this class.

If you’re really ambitious and computer savvy, you can try to build Scala (http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/). It’s very fun to work with and it easily connects with MIDI controllers.

## Grading Information

If you are taking this course for four units, all the following apply. If you are taking the course for fewer than four units, please see the section below detailing what is expected for what number of units.

- 10% discussion and participation
- 50% assignments (x4, plus twice-weekly listening responses)
- 40% final

### Assignments
Weekly assignments will consist of scale construction or creation exercises, written discussions, and/or etudes written in the tuning systems we study. I write up a cheatsheet for working with ratios, available [here](tuning/ratioCheatsheet.pdf).

__IF YOU'RE READING THIS BEFORE JUNE 29, ASSIGNMENTS MAY (PROBABLY WILL, MAYBE, MIGHT, NOT SURE) CHANGE.__

- __Assignment 1__: Create an octave scale using one of the three Greek genera. In a couple paragraphs, describe what you did (i.e. analyze your tuning) and create a short etude (musical style is your choice) using your tuning. The etude can be recorded or written (quasi-notation). You can use any mode of the tuning you'd like, just be sure to note which mode you're using.
- __Assignment 2__: Create an just intonation with the 5-, 7-, or 11-limit, use at least two primes. (Remember you don't have to use all primes; i.e. 3- and 7-limit, 5- and 11-limit, etc). Your scale can be any size but use the harmonies meaningfully. In a paragraph or so, describe what you did (i.e. analyze your tuning) and create a short etude (musical style is your choice) using your tuning. The etude can be recorded or written (quasi-notation). EXTRA CREDIT (+5%): Tastefully include some 13-limit pitches. __Due before class on Tuesday, July 14.__
- __Assignment 3__: Given all the scholarly debate surrounding Bach's tuning system, does it actually matter _exactly_ which system of well-temperament he used? In 3-5 paragraphs (approx. 300-500 words), argue a position. Note there are no right or wrong answers but there are bad, lazy, or poorly thought out answers. More words is not necessarily better (Mark Twain: "I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.") __Due before class on Tuesday, July 21.__
- __Assignment 4__: Write a short proposal for your final project including the format and topic. __Due Wednesday, July 29, at midnight__

__Recording your Work:__ The easiest way to record an etude that you want to play will be to use a screen capture program such as [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/), which works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. OBS is designed for streaming but it's very easy to record the output from any program instead of streaming. [This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpbxNPVJwbE) does a good job of explaining how to do it. Here is [another tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL0rqcNxsO0) if you prefer British accents.

### Final Project
The final project will consist of one of two things: a short research paper (4-6 pages, 12 point font, double-spaced) on a temperment discussed, including its history, implications, and usage; or a longer etude (~3 minutes) using a temperament of your own creation. The latter must be accompanied by an equally brief discussion of the tuning system and its implications (2-3 pages, 12 point font, double-spaced).  These papers should also include diagrams as needed. __FINAL PROJECT IS DUE THE SATURDAY OF WEEK 5 BY 11:59PM PST.__

For those that choose an etude, you will be showing it in the final class of the session although the completed project (etude + short paper) is due on Saturday. For those that choose a research paper, you will have a short (≈15min) presentation on your topic. Prepare accordingly.

### Listening Responses
These will be  required after almost every class on Canvas. You have been divided randomly into groups to try to facilitate some sort of social interaction given the circumstances. __Please listen to all the pieces.__ What I expect is the following:

1. Respond to one of the works (or videos). The response should be approximately 50 words (at least) and say something meaningful about what you thought about the work. I'm not expecting you to analyze the piece (you're very welcome to, however) or have an [afflatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afflatus) but say something more than, "I liked (or didn't like) it," (though you don't have to like it). Try to compare it to the other music you've heard, even if it's not from this class. This will get easier as we get to listen to more and more music.
2. Respond to the response of one of the peers in your group. Best way to go about that is to contrast what you thought of some piece with what they thought. Hence, it's helpful to be more descriptive than write a single sentence so everyone has something to work with! If no one else has posted, you won't be held accountable for not responding to anyone.

__All responses are due within three days of assignment at midnight (i.e. Tuesdays are due Friday, Thursdays are due Sunday).__ If you find another work in the vein we're listening to and want to recommend it, please do!

### Late or Missing Assignments
Given the extremely short summer session, late assignments will not be accepted without adequate forewarning. Plan accordingly.

### Grading Procedure and Feedback
Students are graded on an absolute scale and are expected to complete all assignments on time. Assignments will typically be assigned on the last meeting that takes place during the week and will be due at the first meeting in the following week (i.e. class is Tuesday/Thursday. Assigned Thursday, due Tuesday). Every effort will be made to provide useful feedback in a timely manner.

### Attendance and Participation
Attending class is critical to have a firm grasp of the material. You will be graded on your participation in in-class discussions which mandates your appearance in class.

### By Unit Breakdown
If you are taking the course for less than four units, please see the requirements below.

|Units|Requirements |
|One |Reading and listening responses |
|Two | Reading, listening responses, a short final project (4 page paper or 1 minute etude) |
|Three| Reading, listening responses, and a full final project OR all the assignments|
|Four| All the things |

## Classes

### Week 1: Introduction and Ancient Greek Systems
#### [Tuesday](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A0bS2g-Yw0IddxytXEZCTCvwSg1iwEZx?usp=sharing)
- Introduction to the course including the syllabus, expectations, and general housekeeping.
- How we hear frequency
  - We do no hear linearly but logarithmically.
  - If we have a tone of 200Hz, the next octave is 400Hz, the octave after is 800Hz, etc. This means that a increase of, say, 50Hz, is a different "distance" depending on where we start.
    - 100Hz + 50Hz = 150Hz (i.e. a tritone). 1000Hz + 50Hz = 1050Hz (i.e. something a little less than a halfstep).
  - It is for this reason we often use ratios to describe musical intervals and pitches.
- Basic units of measurement
  - Octave, fifth, halfstep, cents.
  - Cents will be gone into detail later but just accept on my word what it is for now!
- The harmonic series
  - The fundamental building block of traditional musical harmony and the phenomenon from whence scales are traditionally constructed.
  - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music))
  - The mathematical concept is virtually the same.
- So if we have the harmonic series to know what pitches are "in tune" with one another, what's the problem? Why is tuning a thing at all?
  - Things don't actually work out between the ear and mathematics.
  - The comma: what is it and why does it matter?
- The Pythagorean comma

__Homework 4:__<br/>
Write a short proposal for your final project including the format and topic. The final project will consist of one of two things: a short research paper (4-6 pages, 12 point font, double-spaced) on a temperament discussed, including its history, implications, and usage; or a longer etude (~3 minutes) using a temperament of your own creation. The latter must be accompanied by an equally brief discussion of the tuning system and its implications (2-3 pages, 12 point font, double-spaced).  These papers should also include diagrams as needed.
