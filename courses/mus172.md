# Music 172 - Computer Music II

TA - ??

This is the course website for Computer Music II in Spring 2020. A rough outline of the course is below. We will be continuing work in Pd. If you're really savvy, you can use C++ (but make sure it will compile on Linux!!)

### Topics

1. Oscillators, modulators, harmonics, sequencing, polyphony
2. Filters, amplifiers, distortion, waveshaping, harmonizers, MIDI
3. Sampling, looping, brassage, granular techniques
4. Spectral techniques, convolution, time & pitch shifting
5. Spatialization, reverb, vbap, ambisonics
6. Physical modeling, waveguides, modal synthesis

It's a lot of material and we will get through at least item 5. We will dive more in depth on some material if there is interest and time.

There will be four homeworks, generally assigned on a Thursday and due the following Thursday on whatever topic we have been discussing. As is tradition, all your work should be original and copying/pasting from online or your classmates is not accepted. You are welcome to work together but outright copying will cause you to fail the assignment. Late assignments are accepted as long as it is before the due date of the following assignment; that is, you can turn homework one in up to the due date of homework 2. A late assignment can earn a maximum of 90% (points are calculated normally, then multiplied by 0.9). There will be a final project that you will be showing in class during finals week.  Please turn in all assignments as ZIP files (or tar) with all the paths correctly resolved if you use sound files. They should be turned in via email to both myself and your TA.

There is also a homework 0 that is ungraded, assigned on the first day of class. If you'd like, send a recent piece of yours (or piece of software) and something you've been listening to or watching lately. I'm curious to know what you all listen to and make.

#### Grade Breakdown
- 60% homework (15 points each)
- 30% final
- 10% participation (including showing your final in class)

### Text
The most often cited resource will be Miller Puckette's book [The Theory and Technique of Electronic Music](http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques.htm).


Also, please download these general abstractions (or make your own). They'll make your life easier: [abstractions](https://notthatintomusic.com)

### Course Notes
Course notes and patches will appear here as the quarter progresses.

#### Disclaimer
In the interest of full transparency, this is the first course I'm teaching at UCSD and the first course I've taught for a few years. Bear with me as I regain my bearings and don't hesitate to provide me with feedback during the quarter. I'm here to help you learn and if it can be done better, I'm all ears.
