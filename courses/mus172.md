This is the course website for Computer Music II in Spring 2020. A tentative/rough outline of the course is below; this may be modified as the course moves along. We will be continuing work in [Pd](https://puredata.info/). You're also welcome to turn in work in Python, Octave/MATLAB, or SuperCollider (no Max as some of us use Linux); for the really savvy, you can use C/C++. However, it is your responsibility to ensure that you note or provide all required packages for your code to run/compile on any operating system.

Given the current situation, the entire course will be delivered online via [Zoom](ucsd.zoom.us/), likely with Canvas as a significant resource. You should all have a licensed Zoom account through UCSD; let me know if you are unable to get it. I figure most (all?) of you are fairly computer-literate so I am not averse to using another software, such as [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) or [Slack](https://slack.com/). It will be a trial-and-error sort of situation since no one seems to have been prepared for this; any and all feedback on the effectiveness of the lecture delivery during the quarter will be invaluable. I will be recording lectures and posting them online in much the same way Miller does for his classes.

It could also be interesting to explore networked performance/improvisation given how the class will be conducted, depending on student interest. Sending real-time audio over a network (Ã  la JackTrip) is a serious PITA but sending commands through the network as TCP/UDP is far easier and more robust. There are also native objects in Pd for this: [netsend] and [netreceive]. SuperCollider and Python also have easy ways do to this sort of thing.

### Topics

0. _Review_: Sampling, recording, windowing
1. Looping, granular techniques
2. Spectral techniques, convolution, time & pitch shifting
3. Filters, amplifiers, distortion, waveshaping, harmonizers, MIDI
4. Networked performance
5. Spatialization, reverb, vbap, ambisonics

It's a lot of material and we will get through as much as we can. We will dive more in depth on some material if there is interest and time. This also includes potentially jettisoning problematic material given the online nature of the course (specialization, unfortunately, seems to be a prime target since we can't actually listen to anything). Regardless, I _highly_ recommend that each of you purchase a good set of over-ear headphones.

There will be eight homeworks, generally assigned on a Thursday and due the following Thursday on whatever topic we have been discussing. As is tradition, all your work should be original and copying/pasting from online or your classmates is not accepted. You are welcome to work together but outright copying will cause you to fail the assignment. Late assignments are accepted as long as it is before the due date of the following assignment; that is, you can turn homework one in up to the due date of homework two. A late assignment can earn a maximum of 90% (points are calculated normally, then multiplied by 0.9). There will be a final project that you will be showing "in class" during finals week.  Please turn in all assignments as ZIP files (or tar) with all the paths correctly resolved if you use any external files. They should be turned in via email to both myself and your TA (or Canvas??).

There is also a homework 0 that is ungraded, assigned on the first day of class. If you'd like, send a recent piece of yours (or piece of software) and something you've been listening to or watching lately. I'm curious to know what you all listen to and make.

#### Grade Breakdown
- 60% homework (15 points each)
- 30% final
- 10% participation (including showing your final)

### Resources
The most often cited resource will be Miller Puckette's book [The Theory and Technique of Electronic Music](http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques.htm). There are also the following websites with valuable information on DSP in general:
- [Global JOS Index](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/jospubs.html)
- [DAFX](http://www.dafx.de/DAFX_Book_Page_2nd_edition/index.html)
- [Designing Sound](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/designing-sound)

Also, please download these general abstractions (or make your own). They'll make your life easier: [abstractions](abstractions.zip). I'll add other material as the quarter progresses.

### Course Notes
Course notes and patches will appear here as the quarter progresses.

#### Disclaimer
In the interest of full transparency, this is the first course I'm teaching at UCSD and the first course I've taught for a few years. Bear with me as I regain my bearings and don't hesitate to provide me with feedback during the quarter. I'm here to help you learn and if it can be done better, I'm all ears.
