# Music Theory 4 - A Very Brief Introduction to Electronic Music

I could show you several pieces which stand as important milestones in electronic music but, frankly, that's not very interesting or useful (though I've provided a list of some of the seminal works below). I'd rather show you works that I find interesting and which you might not otherwise encounter in a "traditional" music education. Unless you go to UCSD.

### Seminal Works in Electronic Music (in no particular order)

- Edgard Varèse: Poème électronique (1958)
  - A truly incredible work of music
  - [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-R3F3ZVbi8), [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po%C3%A8me_%C3%A9lectronique)
- John Cage: Williams Mix (1051-32)
  - For eight simultaneously played independent quarter-inch magnetic tapes
  - Created from a paper score that serves as a set of instructions on how to splice the tape together.
  - [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ql4Ophbt7k), [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Mix)
  - Also see Cage's _Imaginary Landscape_ series.
- Iannis Xenakis: Mycenae Alpha (1978)
  - Created with the [UPIC system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPIC), a technology by which sounds could be "drawn"
  - [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yztoaNakKok)
- Pierre Schaeffer: Etude aux chemins de fer (1948)
  - From his _Cinq études de bruits_.
  - Schaeffer is the "father" of what is called musique concrete. This is the technique of sampling and using "real" or "found" sounds in musical works.
  - [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9pOq8u6-bA), [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinq_%C3%A9tudes_de_bruits)
- Steve Reich: Come Out (1966)
  - Early experiments with tape and what is called "phasing", a process by which two copies of the same sample are slowly moved away from each other in time, creating new rhythms and harmonies.
  - [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZUB5iSEifI), [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Out_(Reich))
- Karlheinz Stockhausen: Gesang der Jünglinge (1955-56)
  - The first work considered a masterpiece in electronic music
