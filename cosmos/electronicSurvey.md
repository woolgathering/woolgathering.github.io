# A brief survey of electronic music and digital sound art

## Early Electronic Music (in the concert music tradition)

### Steve Reich: Tape Music

 - [It's Gonna Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vugqRAX7xQE)
 - [Come Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WVh1D0N50)

Steve Reich's tape music is demonstrative of how few a simple manipulations can go a long way compositionally. In both _Come Out_ and _It's Gonna Rain_, Reich uses delay and multiple copies of the same thing in each speaker. By varying these, he acheives interesting psychoacoustic and musical effects.


### Pierre Schaeffer: Etude aux Chemins de Fer (1948)

 - [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwoQlYUVTk)

In 1948, Pierre Schaeffer developed _musique concrete_ (the entire concept was actually preceeded in 1944 by the Egyptian composer Halim El-Dabh's _Wire Recorder Piece_). In this work, Schaeffer used the sounds of trains to create a sonic landscape through which the listener travels. His work prefigures much of the modern "soundscape" works.


### Karlheinz Stockhausen: Gesang der JÃ¼nglinge (1955-56)

 - [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1Psx24n3rM)

This is an early electronic music piece that uses both electronically generated sounds and those of the human voice. Moreover, it was originally created for five channels, later reduced to four, and thus was one of the first spaitally implemented electronic works.

### Alvin Lucier: Music for Solo Performer (1965)

 - [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIPU2ynqy2Y&t=542s)

In _Music for Solo Performer_, Lucier amplifies the alpha waves produced by his brain to activate the magnetic coils of speakers. These coils are then placed on percussion instruments which are vibrated when Lucier produces sufficient amplitude. Note how his eyes are closed; the brain naturally produces high amplitude alpha waves in the occipital lobe when the eyes are closed.

### Brian Eno: Music for Airports (1978)

 - [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNwYtllyt3Q)

Created entirely from layered tape loops from a piano, Eno's _Music for Airports_ is the original ambient album that was, indeed, ambient: it was intended as background music, literally. This takes Erik Satie's "furniture music" into a new era.
