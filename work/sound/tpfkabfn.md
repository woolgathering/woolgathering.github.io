_Program Notes_: <br/><br/>
_the piece formerly known as __Boring Formless Nonsense___ pits the physicality of the saxophone against the player, exploiting the point of contact between that physicality and traditional technique. It is a meditation on breathing, the breath as pacing. It asks the player to inhabit a static space which continually tries to push the player out by contortion and strain. It is an exercise in focus, in creating a placid world on the outside while much strain and tension inhabits the inside. It is a dramatization of daily life in which the struggle to maintain appearance can be diametrically opposed to inner experience.
